POV:                 True
Motivation:          A former cook in a baron's house. Was seduced by his second son into having an affair. After he was killed in combat, she was driven from the house and had Miratha on her own. 
                     Works now at a small restaurant in her 50's. Receives most of Miratha's pay and saves and invests it as shredly as possible.
                     Over time, she has turned it into quite the nest egg, unknown to Miratha. She hopes to one day use it as a dowry for her daughter.
                     She does not know that her daughter had a miscarriage, only that she was kicked out of the Merchant's family - she suspects there was an affair but Miratha never told her.
Goal:                To give Miratha the happiness she deserves.
