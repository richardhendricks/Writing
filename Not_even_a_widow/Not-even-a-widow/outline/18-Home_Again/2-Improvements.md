summaryFull:    HArriet realizes she doesn't know how the BK and his retainers are getting paid.  He says not to worry about it, they took the ransom money she gave them and made some investments.
                Investments in what?
                Better you don't know, little miss.
                O-ok. are you sure those will be enough?
                Oh, more than sufficient for my men and I *laughing*
                That said, there is the extra money the NE King gave you, right? We should talk about investing that as well.
                
                BK and his retainers talk to Harriet about investing in her county. Tell her that a mill would help her farmers save on transport costs since they don't have to go to the mill in the neighboring county (perhaps the neighbor is the enemy at court? Or friendly to them anyways) and pay the miller there taxes.
                HAve to find a miller's son and some boys to help - recruit from within her county if possible instead of capital orphanages.
                Saves money for farmers, and generates county income.
                New mill means updated tech using turbine instead of waterwheel as well, should be much faster than the old mill, and offer additional services such as threshing the grain on site using machines. Maybe one retainer is good with numbers or engineering and understands these things.
