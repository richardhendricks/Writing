summaryFull:    Drop off seamstress apprentice with the one she met before, talk to her about making clothes for a wedding
                she says she isn't qualified for a noble wedding
                Harriet clarifies it isn't for her, it's for her head maid. She's getting married to her ... head guard? what do we call the bandit king? Maybe she herself is a little confused.
                Anyways, it's a marriage between commoners. will need bride and groom attire, as well as best man outfits for his remaining men, and bridesmaid's outfits for Harriet and her two new maids-in-training.
                
                Seamstress and her apprentice are also invited to come along in case any alterations are needed on site. And are welcome to stay during the wedding itself.
                She understands this will be a great strain on her work, and brings forth the young girl as a new apprentice for the seamstress.
                
                There is a little bit of confusion and potential animosity, but then She calls the seamstress's current daughter big sis and that immediately melts her heart. They welcome her to the family. Harriet talks to her on the side, saying she understands a normal apprenticeship would not allow for any payment, but says that with this big order, and with her house directing further sewing needs to this shop, she hopes the seamstress can give the apprentices a reasonable allowance. She agrees that would be fine.
                Also would like tableclothes for the banquet afterwards, they will be done in the BKs old barony's colors of green and gold.
