summaryFull:    Gets a cut on her face while fighting an attacker in the Southland attempting to kill the southern prince. Refuses healing magic, says it is an honorably earned scar by her attacker. Sword brightens and shines, and the cut heals but leaves a thin visible line.
                
                He ends up killing Martine from the BK party.
                At that she just goes fucking stone cold.
                
                Asks him his name, his hometown, his funeral rites, repeatedly.
                She just brutally beats him. Instead of taking any opportunity to win, she just ruthlessly tortures him with the blade. Stabs his legs, slices his arms, finally hits him in the gut.
                
                Her men see this and are appalled. Her retainers know the sword is special,  but her betrothed's men dont and have heard only the rumors of Harriet the Hearse.
                
                When she is stopped by her fiance she realizes the sword was making her do this. At that, she mercy-kills the gutted assassin.
                
                The other assassin decides to back away from the party, and tells Harriet her opponent's name, hometown, funeral rites, and then departs down an alleyway as the town guard arrives. Name is Dororo, his family comes from a mining village on the cliffs to the south where they do a funeral pyre on the hill above the village, when the wind  blows away from town.
                
                She gets back she talks to fhe dwarf who tells her that unless she is mentally strong the swords bloodlust will take over.
