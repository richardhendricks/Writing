summaryFull:    brings home Dororo.
                Sets up funeral pyre
                
                Assassin's village is in the high mountains, do sky burials up there.
                Villagers ask about his older brother
                She doesnt know, he never mentioned him
                During the ceremony, in the boulders nearby someone dressed in a gray claok with newr perfect camouflage.
                Blue eyes visible under the hood
                Swears venegance? Swears to learn more about her? Vengeance seems petty? Maybe wants to understand this girl who kills and feels for her victims, unlike how he can kill and feel nothing.
                
                She killed you, little brother. And yet she brought you home to feed the sky gods, telling everyone a nice fiction so that we arent despised as the assassins we are. Why am I not angry? Why does your death not drive me towards vengeance? How can this girl feel so much for someone she never knew, and yet I feel nothing.
                Should he trail her? Protect her from the shadows? Attempt to kill her?
                You brought my brother home. Without your mercy, his body would have been tossed in a trash heap. Thank you. I promise I will never raise a weapon against you again.
                
                
                has to wait until sunset when the winds tend to blow awy from town.
                
                While they are watching the pyre, behind them is the other assassin in the forest. He watches the pyre without emotion.
                
                Afterwards he approaches the party and thanks them for taking his brother home and seeing that he gets a proper burial instead of being throw on the trash heap.
