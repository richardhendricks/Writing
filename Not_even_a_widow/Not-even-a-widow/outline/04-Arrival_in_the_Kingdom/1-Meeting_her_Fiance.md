summaryFull:    Her initial meeting with her betrothed
                Hasn't seen her in a few years, since he graduated and joined the kingdom's army
                
                She is wearing long gloves and/or a long sleeved blouse/jacket
                
                He acts like a jerk at first. Disappointed his family didn't come for him.
                
                He didn't realize how high the ransom was set, Harriet tells him, and he is a little flabbergasted.  Finally asks why she came.
                
                Nobody else would pay the ransom. I am paying it from my dowry.
                
                Says that's ludicrous. What the hell is she talking about:? And why are you wearing a winter coat, it's the middle of spring.
                
                Miratha walks up to him and pulls up her sleeve telling him they were attacked by bandits and Harriet had to fight them and got cuts and bruises during the fight. She's too embarassed to show you, you dolt. We surrendered the rest of our _fine_ clothes to the bandits to be allowed to keep enough to pay for your sorry ass.
                
                Miratha leaves
                
                Count and his staff are just fucking appalled at his behavior. The count chastises him for berating Harriet. Orders his butler to see Lord Jerkface to his room.
                
                The count goes to knock on Harriet's door and asks to see her arms.
                
                She has some pretty bad bruises and cuts.
                
                He asks Do you love him?
                
                Who else could a worman with the face of a horse get?
                
                She starts crying and hugs the count.
                
                He has two daugthers, so being fatherly is second nature to him.
                
                If your kindgom had a dozen women like you, they would rule the continent.
                
                *sniff* "What?"
                
                If that _child_ cannot see your value, I will gladly adopt you into my familyt and find you a fiance worth of you here. As I said, if our kingdom had a dozen women like you..."
                
                *mutters* "Perhaps we should rethink not allowing women to train with the sword at our academy. If only I was 20 years younger..."
                
                "My lord?"
                
                "Why am I cursed with such useless daughters??"
                
                "My lord!!"
                
                "Oh, right. Well, maybe a few days with you will light a fire in them."
