                Turns out he isnt a bad fellow per second, but forced to put his people in thia position due to needing funds for raising a levy of troops, fearful the succession may lead to a civil war.
                Harriet convinces him to lower taxes or else he wont have any peasants left .
                
                Bandit leader in a different village
                Mother is hated because her son was pretty evil while there, he was finally driven out, but she is still ostracized. Mayor feels bad for her but cant do much to help except give her food on occasion. 
                Should she come with Harriet? Should she use her Harriet the Hearse rumors to try and clean up his act so the villagers stop abusing her? Her son died in myservice. Disrespecting her sacrifice is disrespecting me. Thank you my lady.
