summaryFull:    What about your maid
                She is my responsibility, her chastity is sacrosant as well
                Oh, uh, no, I mean. Can she cook? We take turns and frankly, all suck
                Will hold cowardly merchant for ransom
                Will let coachmen and wounded guards go free in honor of her payment
                Gives back some of her money as a dowry, and to remember his name fondly
                Unless you wish to be my bandit queen?
                Maid waves and gives him a  doki doki moment
                
                Maid cooks dinner for everyone
                
                Harriet bandages the coachman and the guard.
                
                Nobody for Common soldiers,  sold to slavery?
                Escaped and became bandits
                
                Someone tries to start saying raunchy jokes, his name is Martine.
                
                "There once was a farmer's daughter
                Whose hair kept growing longer and longer..."  
                
                "Dammit Martine, you can't sing those kinds of limericks, little miss here is a noble!"
                He gets ribbed and lightly punched by the other men.
                He goes on to sing slightly less raunchy songs
                
                Towards the end of the night he sings the Adventurer's Wife song for them.
