summaryFull:    My betrothed is fighting the captain of the kings guard? How did this ridiculous situation come about??
                Ever since I first met her, Harriet has been surprising me...
                
                First meeting after betrothal.  He was 13, she was 7. He hated playing with her doll things and kept wanting a sword or books.
                After he leaves she storms up to her father a demands a sword to practice with.
                
                Age gap
                Each time they met they sparred. She kept getting better,  but so did he. His advantage in age gave him strength and reach. He did smile when they fought, which she noticed.
                Last time they met was for his graduation from the academy and her first year enrolling.
                
                She talked about how much she loves swordfighting. He was mostly silent. By that point he had learned that she was not a normal woman, in looks and in attitude.
                
                His friends teased him for being betrothed to such an ugly girl. He looked down as he remembers how he used to join in.
                He suddenly hears a THUMP. "Oof!" And raises his head to srr Harriet flying through the air after the captain had kicked her in the stomach. She had a hard landing, sword and dagger clattering.
