summaryFull:    May we pay the ransom ourselves? For a worthless man who doesn't have the decency to die in battle?
                
                How much is it?
                
                1 kg of gold
                
                My dowry is enough, is it not? 
                
                Her father looks at her, narrows his eyes. What are you thinking? What would be left if you use your dowry to buy a husband? 
                
                What are my options?
                
                She understands the chances of her finding another to marry her are slim. Her face is ... her face and her family fortunes have gone down since her birth due to poor luck. Her best hope would be to end up married to some low ranking uncouth knight. Other likely options would be a lady in waiting to a minor baroness, or being sent to a convent.
                
                Her brothers died during the measles plague 10 years ago. She's the only heir left. And unless she bears a son, the house of Blerfg will be returned to the king, abandoned. But without a large dowry, a noble son is unlikely to be interested, and with an ugly face, even a lowly knight will probably pass her by.
