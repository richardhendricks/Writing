summaryFull:    The retainer and her head Maid go on a scouting mission/date before they leave. She talks about how the sparkle in Harriets eye has left. He talks about how his men are working to develop a network. Meanwhile they go walking. Sort of a date?
                
                In the carriage south is her maid, her betrothed,  and his attendant/bodyguard.
                
                Her 5 retainers are outside. They take turns driving the carriage and riding 4 horses. All their baggage is on the horses and the carriage. Her betrothed has also brought 4 more men of his own who were rescued by Harriet.
