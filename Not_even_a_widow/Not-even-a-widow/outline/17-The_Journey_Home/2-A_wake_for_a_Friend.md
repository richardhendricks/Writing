summaryFull:    Martine's body is up on the carriage, wrapped up.
                
                They stop to spend the night and sit around a fire pit after eating. Harriet talks to the BK to ask about Martine's home, and family. Afterwards, one of the BKs men comments how Martine used to love the dirtiest songs and jokes. Harriet asks them to sing a few.
                
                While they're singing ribald songs and telling jobkes, BK and Mirantha are sitting a little ways off talking about Harriet.  We can see them look at her as she is covering her mouth with the back of her hand laughing at a particularly bad raunchy joke.
                
                Do your balls hang low
                Do they wobble too and fro
                Can you throw 'em o'er your shoulder
                Like a Continental Soldier?
                
                They talk about Harriet, wondering about the changes in the behavior and what happened when she killed the assassin. Miratha is worried that the sword's magic is causing this. The BK doesn't know either, she seems different after returning from the NE kingdom with the sword. She has killed 5 men now. More than most professional soldiers who really never see a campaign. He himself has only killed 3 men, 2 during combat and 1 during their escape. They look again at Harriet laughing with her new girls.
                
                Dancing. 
                Once the men start clapping and dancing around the fire, the older apprentice maid perks up and starts doing a jig with backflips and handstands.  Clearly her family had given her some stage training before she ended up on the streets. 
                
                One of the BKs older men gets on one knee before the smallest maid putting out a hand to dance, who giggles and puts out a hand. He picks her up into the air and dances around with her lifting her up in the air.
                
                As they dance, she is laughing and having a great time, and shouting out Switch Switch and gets passed off to the other men. She yells out "Big brother, Big Brother, swing me higher! Switch, Switch!"
                
                Harriet's Betrothed's older butler steps in front of the seamstress girl and does a noble bow and holds out his hand for a dance with the little girl. They dance together a lot more reserved than the two little maids, looking like a father/daughter at her debutante ball.
                
                After a while the festivities slow down, and Harriet and Miratha begins singing the song the Adventurer's Wife.
                
                ---
                After the festivities have died down, the retainers have setup bedrolls around the firepit and started snoring loudly.  The girls have entered the carriage to sleep inside, with Harriet and her fiance on one bench, the seamstress girl and the two new apprentice maids piled up on the other.
                
                Outside, BK and Mirantha are still quietly talking on the log while taking watch. BK grabs her hand, and proposes to her. Mirantha wants to know why, she's just a maid, he's a lord of a lost barony he can reclaim. I fell in love with you the minute you agreed to cook for my men. They smile, and kiss.  
                
                After they part, he says "I made a vow to serve Harriet for life." 
                "I know, I have that same vow in my heart." 
                "But...Harriet made me promise yesterday on my honor, my blood, and my soul to always put your safety first."
                "What?"
                "She said that if the need comes, I am to save you over her. If the time ever comes that there needs to be a choice made, to put you first..."
                "That silly girl, how could I ever live without her?"
                "She loves you very much, Miratha. More than her own mother."  
                Mirantha hugs him.
                She says "If you ever leave her to save me I will cut off your balls"
                "I know" pats her head.
                
                and then they go together to a tent setup for him.
