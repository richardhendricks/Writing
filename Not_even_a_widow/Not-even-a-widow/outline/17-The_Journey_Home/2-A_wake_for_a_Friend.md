summaryFull:    Martine's body is up on the carriage, wrapped up.
                
                They stop to spend the night and sit around a fire pit after eating. Harriet talks to the BK to ask about Martine's home, and family. Afterwards, one of the BKs men comments how Martine used to love the dirtiest songs and jokes. Harriet asks them to sing a few.
                
                While they're singing ribald songs and telling jobkes, BK and Mirantha are sitting a little ways off talking about Harriet.  We can see them look at her as she is covering her mouth with the back of her hand laughing at a particularly bad raunchy joke.
                
                Do your balls hang low
                Do they wobble too and fro
                Can you throw 'em o'er your shoulder
                Like a Continental Soldier?
                
                They talk about Harriet, wondering about the changes in the behavior and what happened when she killed the assassin. Miratha is worried that the sword's magic is causing this. The BK doesn't know either, she seems different after returning from the NE kingdom with the sword. She has killed 5 men now. More than most professional soldiers who really never see a campaign. He himself has only killed 3 men, 2 during combat and 1 during their escape. They look again at Harriet laughing with her new girls.
                
                After a while the festivities slow down, and Harriet and Miratha begins singing the song the Adventurer's Wife.
                
                As Harriets finishes the last words of yhe song into silence arpund the crackling bonfire,
                
                I never really cared for this song when I was little. My mother would sing it by herself while my father was away on campaigns for the old King. Young me thought the song should be loud, and about a proud wife seeing her victorious husband home.
                
                Now?
                
                After he didnt come home from his final campaign, and mother sang it to the returning triumphant army, I understand now what it means.
                
                Is she still alive?
                
                She passed while we were imprisoned. The bastards running the prison mine found out and made my life hell for months until we finally escaped.
                
                I'm so sorry.
                
                Oh don't weep for me. Cry for my mother who had to sing that song twice without anyone coming home to her.
                
                Mirantha leans towards BK and gives him a kiss.
                The BK gets red faced and then jumps up. "Cmon boys, what's a wake without proper dancing!" The retainers immediately start clapping a beat as BK takes Miratha by the hand and pulls her up, swinging her into a common tavern dance. The rest of the men jump up and partner off with each other or the new apprentices.
                
                Once the men start clapping and dancing around the fire, the older apprentice maid perks up and starts doing a jig with backflips and handstands.  Clearly her family had given her some stage training before she ended up on the streets.
                
                One of the BKs older men gets on one knee before the smallest maid putting out a hand to dance, who giggles and puts out a hand. He picks her up into the air and dances around with her lifting her up in the air.
                
                As they dance, she is laughing and having a great time, and shouting out Switch Switch and gets passed off to the other men. She yells out "Big brother, Big Brother, swing me higher! Switch, Switch!"
                
                Harriet's Betrothed's older butler steps in front of the seamstress girl and does a noble bow and holds out his hand for a dance with the little girl. They dance together a lot more reserved than the two little maids, looking like a father/daughter at her debutante ball.
                
                Harriets fiance stands up, and goes to ine knee in front of her, offering his hand in the formal noble way to request a dance. She turns a little red in the face as she places her hand injis, and he stands, pulling both of them up together with a cheer from the whole clearing.
                
                Suddenly with a mischievous grin, Harriet grabs his other hand and swings him around in that same dance of joy. His face shows him startled, then laughing as his switches from a formal watlz to the fast commoner jig.
                
                ---
                After the festivities have died down, the retainers have setup bedrolls around the firepit and started snoring loudly.  The girls have entered the carriage to sleep inside, with Harriet and her fiance(?) on one bench, the seamstress girl and the two new apprentice maids piled up on the other.
                
                Outside, BK and Mirantha are still quietly talking on the log while taking watch. BK grabs her hand, and proposes to her. Mirantha wants to know why, she's just a maid, he's a lord of a lost barony he can reclaim. I fell in love with you the minute you agreed to cook for my men. They smile, and kiss.
                
                After they part, he says "I made a vow to serve Harriet for life."
                "I know, I have that same vow in my heart."
                
                "But...Harriet made me promise yesterday on my honor, my blood, and my soul to always put your safety first."
                "What?"
                
                "She said that if the need comes, I am to save you over her. If the time ever comes that there needs to be a choice made, to put you first..."
                "That silly girl, how could I ever live without her?"
                
                "She loves you very much, Miratha. More than her own mother."
                Mirantha hugs him.
                She says "If you ever leave her to save me I will cut off your balls and feed them to you"
                He laughs, reaches down and kisses her. "I know"
                
                and then they go together to a tent setup for him.
