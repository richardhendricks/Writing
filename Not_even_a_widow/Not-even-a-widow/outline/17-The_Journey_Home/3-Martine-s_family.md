summaryFull:    Only one alive is his great uncle.
                
                When harriet tells his uncle about Martine's death, he notices the BK in the background while Harriet is giving her usual spiel.
                Uncle yells at BK, they get into an altercation, eventually they reconcile.
                harriet and her entourage stay there a few days while they wait for a funeral for Martine. Placed in the family mausoleum next to his mother and father. 
                
                He's the first person to ever die protecting her, and she is deeply troubled by this. She's killed men, but this is different. 
                
                Uncle asks BK for Martine's story.  Tells him how they were captured and held for ransom, and when the ransom never came they were all sent to the mines and brutally treated, beaten, treated as criminals.  They finally escaped and tried their hand at banditry, and were pretty terrible at it.
                
                Uncle says we never received a letter of ransom. BK is surpirsed, he knows multiple letters were sent. Something is very fishy here. Kingdom was hiding these letters or refusing to send them on to their families (How did Harriet's betrothed's family find out? Backchannel?) Turns out they would have these skirmishes to take out support against that faction of the throne. And the 2nd prince tended to do this frequently, since both BK and Harriet's betrothed belong to factions supporting the first prince.  
                Harriet's fiancee asks Harriet how she found out, they didn't go through the kings,  they went directly to the family because the NE count had a merchantile relationship to betrothed's family?
                This explains why diplomat who showed up during Harriet's demonstration was so surprised by her paying off the ransom. He had not delivered any of the ransom notices.
                
                He still thanks BK and Harriet for bringing Martine back to his home.
