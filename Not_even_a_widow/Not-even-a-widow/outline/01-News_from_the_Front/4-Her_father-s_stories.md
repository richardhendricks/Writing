summaryFull:    When I was young, my father used to regale me of his time with the Northern Subjugation Expediton. Sent north to put down a minor rebellion, they fought for 18 months in the hellish northern lands. 80 percent of their losses weren't even from the fighting - swamps in the summer with disease carryong mosqiitos,  and bone chilling cold in the winter. Anyway, father and baron blahblsh became very close. And so they promised to bretrothe their children, if the chance arose. My father's star never rose, but his friends rose quite high. And yet he still kept up.his end of the bargain.  firstborn are both sons, but the second children fortuitously did work.
