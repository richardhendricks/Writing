summaryFull:    Magic class for third years
                Teacher is talking about circles
                See the students 
                Harriet looks at them. Boys wear hair ties, mostly black. The ones with admirers have colorful ties given by a girl.
                For the girls, its all about the hair ornaments. For me, I have a pair of black hair sticks hiding a secret, and a couple of unadorned hair pins. I am betrothed but we aren't close enough yet to exchange gifts. And being...who I am, I probably wont get any affectionate gifts from him anyways.
                
                Suddenly there is a firm rap at the door, and the teacher sighs and responds with an "Enter" as a small murmur comes from the class. 
                
                One of the office pages for this period, a first year boy, opens the door and walks in with a solemn face.
                
                "Lady Harriet, your parents are here to pick you up.  Please attend and come to the office."
                
                Harriet, surprised, puts away her books and puts them in her bag.
                
                As she is leaving the room, one student begins clapping his cupped hands together to make a"clippety-clop" sound, and another does a "Neigh" sound while hiding his mouth as she leaves through the door.
                
                The teacher, appalled by this behavior, immediately calls out the two boys with detention.
                
                Harriet, a fairly tall girl for her class with a long face, has had a nickname of "Horse Face Harriet" since her first year.
                
                Reflects on how she used to beat up the boys in their estate town for calling her names, until the mayor begged her father to make her stop.  He scolded her, but the boys kept doing it so she whipped their ass one more time and got a beating. 
                They heard it from outside and tried to tease her again but she glared at them so strong they got terrified and stopped. She simply said I wonder how bad my beating would be if I broke your arm.
                
                She walks out of class with her back ramrod straight.
