    <outline name="Questions" ID="2" description="How did a kingdom founded by a warrior and his adventurer queen end up not letting women fight?&#10;Perhaps where they emigrated from in the east, the women weren't allowed to fight there either and the tradition was too strong."/>
    <outline name="Noble Academy" ID="0" description="Where Harriet is currently.&#10;Nobles enter for free, commoners can pay.&#10;Enter at 13, do 3 years at beginner, then 3 years at advanced.&#10;&#10;Harriet leaves academy at 16 to rescue her betrothed, has to repeat the 3rd year.&#10;She entered at 13, just as her betrothed graduated at 19. &#10;&#10;Her favorite teacher at the academy is the swordmaster"/>

    <outline name="Eastern Kingdom" ID="4" description="A kingdom falling into civil war - basically a proxy fight between Home kingdom and Northeastern kingdom. Harriet has to travel through here to reach her betrothed in the Northeastern kingdom because technically it isn't at war.&#10;&#10;She'll probably make her stand here in vol 2 if there is one?"/>
    <outline name="Northeastern Kingdom" ID="5" description="Where Harriet's betrothed is captured during a minor campaign.&#10;&#10;The king here gives Harriet the sword because he knows its bloody history and power. He has a kinda sinister ulterior motive in sending this sword back in her hands  - he expects her to disrupt her home kingdom with its power and bloodlust.&#10;&#10;In a cold war with the home kingdom, mostly minor border skirmishes.  They see them as a minor amusement since they feel like the NE kingdom is more powerful than the home kingdom. Uses the Eastern kingdom disgruntled nobles as a proxy war with the home kingdom, who supports the eastern king.&#10;&#10;At the start, relations are strained enough it isn't safe to travel between the home and northeastern kingdoms directly."/>
    <outline name="Harriet's Family" ID="1" description="Her father was a minor noble who ended up with a small barony after the northern subjugation campaign. He never managed to make much of it. He sees his failures as reflected by his ugly daughter. He is very jealous of his successful war buddy.&#10;&#10;Her mother was a rich merchant's dauighter from the north. Met during the subjugation campaign and fell in love. She's shrewd, but loves Harriet a lot. Was very sick after Harriet's birth so Mirantha was hired as a wet nurse and lady's maid.&#10;&#10;Her elder brother died from a plague, he was 5 years older than her. Died when she was 7, he didn't get to go to the Academy.&#10;&#10;Land is located in the western parts of the kindgom. Still mostly undeveloped, 1 small town and a bunch of villages. Major output is wheat. No local mills, one of the investments Harriet's retainers suggest with the eastern king's money is building their own mill on the river flowing through the barony so they don't have to send it to the county next door for milling and paying fees and transport.&#10;&#10;"/>
    <outline name="Betrothed's family" ID="6" description="Father was a war hero during the northern subjugation campaign.  Was granted a barony by the king, has grown it successfully into a successful county and been promoted to Count. Married the third daughter of a neighboring county whom they share tight economic ties. Loves to hunt, plays military games. Has a decently sized army for protection.&#10;&#10;Mother's the third daughter of a viscount. Pretty but a little airheaded. Prefers to spend time socializing in the capital than in the sticks on the estate.&#10;&#10;Land is located in the southern part of the kingdom. Mostly forests that they are slowly converting into farmlands with pockets kept for timber."/>
