The elf boy has already managed to kill a deer, and is currently dresssing it. It hangs from a treebranch already gutted with its blood and entrails around it at the bottom.
"I'll show them. I know we aren't doing all that well, and regular meat will be a nice addition to our meals."
As he keeps grumbling, he starts cutting the hide from the deer, no doubt hoping to sell it in the market for some extra coins.
Suddenly he hears a loud rustle coming from the right.

Oh no. It's a owlbear, a giant monster with the head of an owl. A dangerous beast to encounter at any time, but now it has smelled his prey.

"Damn! I forgot to bury the entrails and move the drained body elsewhere before harvesting the parts"

The elf boy decided discretion was the better part of valor and ran away from the bear and his kill, cursing the whole time.

Unfortunately the owlbear took chase.

The boy ran as fast as he could, but the bear continued to gain on him.

Eventually he saw some elven markers on a tree showing the edge of their territory, with the owl bear still hot on his heels. Before he knew it, he had reached the edge of a sleep slope, not quite a cliff, but dangerous none the less.

Unable to stop, he stumbled and fell down the slope, the owlbear tumbling a few seconds behind him.

As they reached the bottom, he hit a tree with a sharp CRACK, and a shooting pain erupted in his left leg. "Aggggh!"

The owlbear, not having any luck with its traction either, rolled down the hill next to him and smashed into an old tree stump with a large protruding branch.  After a few seconds of struggle, it finally gasped its last breath.
