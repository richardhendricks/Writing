After they had finished eating, Mudfoot kicked dirt over the cooking fire, putting it out. She gestured towards Dappled and up the slope, offering her arm to help get him up. 

They slowly made their way up the slope, with him holding onto Mudfoot while she carried his crutch for him. 

Once they reached the top, she pointed at a few scratches on the trees near the slope. Dappled realized these were goblin markings. She pointed to the markings, herself, did a little walking gesture towards the elven woods and then grabbed a couple of sticks and poked her chest with them. 

It took Dappled a few times of watching this pantomine to realize that she was telling him this was as far as she could go - any further would be Elf territory and she would be shot on sight. He leaned over and gave her a hug in thanks for her help. She was surprised, and then returned his hug in a firm grip that caused him to gasp at the sore ribs. She let go at that and laughed a little.

Mudfoot handed back his crutch and said "-Good bye fair elf-" to him.

He repeated it back to her. "-G-goodbye fair elf-."

This caused her to laugh some more at his misunderstanding.

She pointed to herself and said "-Good bye fair elf-" pointing to him, and then said "-Good bye fair goblin-" as she pointed from him to her. 

Dappled understood what she meant, and after she said "-Good bye fair elf-" he responded with "-Good bye fair goblin-".

She turned around, and begun descending the slope as Dappled watched her go.  After a minute she reappeared at the bottom looking back up, and waved, and he waved back. She turned, and ran back into the tree line.

"*What an amazing woman*" he said as he turned around and started to head back into the woods.

After a few hours of walking as the sky began to head towards night, he saw a search party with torches calling his name. Once they met up and saw him, they hurriedly took him home and called for a healer.

His parents were not amused.
