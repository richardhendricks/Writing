"Grandma, tell us a story!"
"Gwamama, pwease! New soree!" The younger sister had recently lost some baby teeth and had the most adorable lisp.

The eldery elf with piercing grey eyes and red hair peppered with salt looked at the two young girls. "Oh? A story is it? How about a goblin story?"

The children looked at each with wary eyes. "Goblin...story?"

"We're big girls now!" They both chant in unison.

"If you want to hear it, you need to promise me to really be big girls. Tragedies dont have happy endings."

The two girls looked at each other with serious looks and nodded together. "We promise!"

"A long time ago..."
