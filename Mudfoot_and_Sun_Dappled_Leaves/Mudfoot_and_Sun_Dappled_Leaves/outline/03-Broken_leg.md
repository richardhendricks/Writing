The boy's leg was broken, no doubt about it.  He looked up the steep slope. "I could get back up normally, but with this leg I have no chance."

As he looked around, he was startled to see a goblin girl looking at him.

She had green skin, pointed ears that went straight up, and fangs protruding down from her mouth. She looked at him in obvious worry, holding onto a fierce looking serrated dagger with both hands.

The boy slowly held up his hands, and groaned as his leg shifted. "*I mean you no harm*"

The girl pointed her dagger at him, moving it up with his hands.

The boy pointed at his leg carefully, "*I think it's broken*"

The girl moved the dagger to her right hand, and keeping an eye on him, reached out and gently poked his leg.

"*Agggh! Why did you do that?!*" 

She backed up, nodded, and put away her dagger. 

She wandered off and and came back with some branches, a couple of small ones and one larger one that still had a large Y at the end.

She took a few thin strips of leather from her belt and efficiently splinted his leg, and rapidly chopped the large branch into a makeshift crutch for him.
