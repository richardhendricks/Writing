The boy pointed to himself and says "*My name is sun-dappled-leaves. Sun. Dappled. Leaves.*"

As he says this, he takes a leaf and waves it about in the sunbeam. Then he points at his eyes, gorgeous dark green with flecks of yellow. "*Sun. Dappled. Leaves.*"

"*Sun. Dappled. Leaves.*" She repeats, in very passable Elvish. This makes him smile such a grin its infectious. She begins dancing and tumbling around the clearing laughing and saying "Sun Dappled Leaves! Sun Dappled Leaves!"

Later after she gets out of breath and comes back, she points at her left foot. Instead of being green like the rest of her body, her left foot is a very dark chocolate brown. "-My name is Mudfoot-" She wiggles her toes with a smile. "-Mudfoot-" 

"-Mudfoot-" repeated the boy, smiling himself. He couldn't dance, but he kept repeating her name over and over "-Mudfoot. Mudfoot. Mudfoot.-" This made the goblin girl immensely happy and she did a few more tumbles "-Mudfoot! Mudfoot!-"

She stopped over by the owlbear and takes out her dagger and begins gutting it. Once that's done, she drags the carcass over to a tree with a large branch and ties a rope to the legs and tries to lift it up. She's so light she can't really get it fully up, but with lots of effort she manages to at least get it upright. She takes her dagger and with some effort removes the valuable beak.  She gives the upper part to Sun-Dappled-Leaves and puts the bottom half in her pouch. She rapidly finishes skinning the rest of the bear, and cuts off some meat and takes a bite of the raw meat.
