"I am old enough to go hunting on my own!" yelled a teen elf. He had green eyes and long blonde air, and a chip on his shoulder the size of a griffon.

"You are not yet old enough. Wait until the next hunting expedition in a few weeks." The motherly voice did little to soothe his teenage (well, for an elf anyways) hormones.

"I don't need to be coddled like a child. I can hunt just fine and put food on the table on my own." grumbled the elf boy.

"Oh, can you now? Well maybe you are big enough to go out on your own." His father, a minor scholar, made the comment without even looking up from his book.

"I'll show you both!" He stormed off, grabbing his bow and backpack before leaving their quaint little house on the edge of the woods.

"I wish you wouldn't encourage him." scolded the mother.

"He'll get cold in a few hours and come home just fine, don't worry. I remember running away from home about his age, and getting chased back by a boar. It's a necessary part of growing up." his father gave in a teaching voice.

"Hmph, I am not one of your students" said the mother as she got up and stormed off on her own.
