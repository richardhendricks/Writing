She bounds over to Dappled, and offers him a slice of the raw meat. "*Uh, I'd rather cook it? Fire?*" He takes two sticks and tries rubbing them together like how you start a fire.

Mudfoot looks curious at this, but doesn't understand. Dappled takes the hot stick and puts it in her hand, so she can feel the heat. Her head perks up. "-Cook meat?-"

She runs off to gather some kindling and a few larger branches and then quickly starts a fire. Dappled is surprised at how quick she is with it, using a firestone and her dagger to throw sparks into some dried moss she found near a tree.

She sliced the owlbear meat thin and speared it with thin branches stripped of leaves that she threaded through the slab up and down, and placed it over the fire to cook. She  went over to an unfamiliar bush and stripped some leaves from a few branches, and crushed them up.  She walked over to him and held the branches to his nose for him to sniff. "*Rosemary? Yes please!*" Dappled pointed to the meat and rubbed his stomach to show that he was OK with the herb.

Mudfoot took the rosemary and slid the springs in between the branches and the meat. After a few minutes the meat began to drip fat onto the fire, flaring up and crackling with each drop. Once it stopped dripping, Mudfoot took the sticks off and set them aside to cool.

She offered Dappled a drink from her skin, which had some stale water inside. She handed Dappled one of the cooled meat skewers covered in rosemary.  He took a bite. It was the gamiest meat he ever tasted, with the rosemary not really covering up the taste at all. The rosemary smell was an assault on his nose that felt like it would cause him to start crying. It was wonderful.
